# Dotfiles for Dev Containers

Installation and configuration scripts for tools that should be present in all my Dev Containers.

## Configuration

### VS Code

Update the dotfiles repository in VS Code settings:

```json
"dotfiles.repository": "koralowiec/dotfiles-devcontainer"
```

No further configuration is required. The `setup.sh` script will run automatically when starting a Dev Container.
